<li> Company/Organization should fill in the Job Notification Form (JNF) and submit it to the Training and Placement Cell (TPC) either as an online form, or a hard copy. The JNF serves as an introduction of the job profile for the candidates and also informs them of the company's requirements.
</li>
<br>
<li>
The JNF is electronically broadcasted to all students, along with all the other information furnished by Company/Organization
</li>
<br>
<li>
 If the Company/Organization wishes to visit the campus and conduct a Pre-Placement Talk (PPT) before the interview sessions, they can send a request along with the preferred dates.
</li>
<br>
<li>
 Suitable dates (Placement Calendar for dates and slots) for Pre Placement Talk (PPT) and written/online examinations are decided as per mutual convenience. The company may also, if interested, conduct selections for summer internships on the same day.
</li>
<br>
<li>
 The TPC generally allots a date to the company for the final placements based on the following preference criteria:<br>
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li> Job profile and growth prospects.</li>
<li> Package being offered by the company (CTC and Take-Home).</li>
<li> Past record of recruitment.</li>
<li> Conduct of initial round of placement before hand.</li>
<li> Feedback from the students/alumni regarding the company.</li>
</ol><br>
<li>
The company can confirm or negotiate the dates with the cell.</li>
</li>
<br>
<li>
 The company can ask for the resumes of interested students and has the liberty to shortlist them.
</li><br>
<li>
 The list of shortlisted students is to be mailed to the TPC by the company prior to the campus selection date.
</li><br>
<li>
 The company visits the campus on scheduled dates and conducts the written/online test/ group discussion/personal interview as a part of their selection procedure during the time slotted to them. It is important to understand that, on the same date, another company may be scheduled before/after yours and any shift is bound to cause inconvenience to self and others.
</li><br>
<li>
The final results of all the companies interviewing in a particular slot are to be submitted to the cell by the end of the slot. In case of a student being selected by more than one company, the student will choose only one of these offers, immediately after the slot/day is over and all the results from the companies scheduled in that slot is received by the cell. His/her choice would be informed to all the concerned companies. In this situation, to ensure that the company does not suffer on the front of recruitment, it is suggested to prepare a panel of students in order of their merit who can be kept waitlisted. Any drop out from the main-list will enable movement of the waitlisted candidates to the list of selected candidates and the same will be informed to the company.
